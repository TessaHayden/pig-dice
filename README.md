### So how do you play Pig?
* Choose a player to go first. That player throws a die and scores as many points as the total shown on the die providing the die doesnâ€™t roll a 1. The player may continue rolling and accumulating points (but risk rolling a 1) or end his turn.

* If the player rolls a 1 his turn is over, he loses all points he accumulated that turn, and he passes the die to the next player.

* Play passes from player to player until a winner is determined.

### How do you win?
The first player to accumulate 100 or more points wins the game.
